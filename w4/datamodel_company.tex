\section{Data Model Description}

The COMPANY database keeps track of a company’s \textcolor{red}{employees}, \textcolor{red}{departments}, and \textcolor{red}{projects}



\begin{enumerate}

\item
  
The company is organized into departments. \\
Each department has a unique \textcolor{green}{name}, a unique \textcolor{green}{number}\\
and a particular employee who \textcolor{yellow}{manages} the department. 
We keep track of the \textcolor{green}{start date} when that employee began managing the department. \\
A department may have several \textcolor{green}{locations}


\item
A department \textcolor{yellow}{controls} a number of projects, each of which has a unique \textcolor{green}{name}, a unique \textcolor{green}{number}, and a single \textcolor{green}{location}

\item
The database will store each employee’s \textcolor{green}{name}, \textcolor{green}{Social Security number}, \textcolor{green}{address}, \textcolor{green}{salary}, \textcolor{green}{sex(gender)}, and \textcolor{green}{birth date}.\\ 
An employee \textcolor{yellow}{is assigned} to one department, but may \textcolor{yellow}{work} on several projects, which are not necessarily controlled by the same department. It is required to keep track of the current \textcolor{green}{number of hours per week} that an employee works on each project\\
**** as well as the direct \textcolor{yellow}{supervisor} of each employee (who is another employee). ****

\item
The database will keep track of the \textcolor{red}{dependents} of each employee for insurance purposes, including each dependent’s \textcolor{green}{first name}, \textcolor{green}{sex}, \textcolor{green}{birth date}, and \textcolor{green}{relationship} to the employee.
